"""
Purpose of the following test(s):
    Verify whether all "public" methods are documented.
    These tests cannot assure that said documentation is any good;
    the tests pass as soon as the "public" elements have a non-None __doc__.
    With "public" I refer to any method not starting with a "_".
    The underscore methods aren't supposed to be used by 3rd parties anyway,
    hence no need for a doc-string.
